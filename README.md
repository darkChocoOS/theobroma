# Theobroma

please don't use this, it's just a thing I made for myself. Use [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) or [Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium) instead


# TODO:

Add Niri to this thing lol, preferrably with a quickshell like DMS or Noctalia to go with it


# Credits

I used snippets and info from the following projects and libraries to make this, go check them out:
[Zirconium](https://github.com/zirconium-dev/zirconium)
[diffuse](https://github.com/renner0e/diffuse/tree/main)
[VedaOS](https://github.com/Lumaeris/vedaos)
